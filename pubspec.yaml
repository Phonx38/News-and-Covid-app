# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

   - images/02.png
   - images/03.png
   - images/04.png
   - images/05.png 
   - images/06.png
   - images/coronaback1.jpg
   - images/coronaback.jpg
   - images/business.gif
   - images/entertainment.gif
   - images/health.gif
   - images/science.gif
   - images/sports.gif
   - images/technology.gif
   - images/general.gif

   - images/doodle.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: LibreBaskerville-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/LibreBaskerville-Bold.ttf

    - family: LibreBaskerville-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/LibreBaskerville-Regular.ttf

    - family: Montserrat-Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Montserrat-Medium.ttf

    - family: Roboto-Light
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Roboto-Light.ttf
    
    - family: AbrilFatface-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/AbrilFatface-Regular.ttf
